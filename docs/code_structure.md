# Code Structure

This document describes you code structure of this software. Mainly, I write down about the directory structure and the purpose of each file.

# Directory

* / - Build files, Configuration files, and etc.
* /app - This directory has one HTML file and the manifest.json file.
* /app/_locales/en - There is one message resource file for English.
* /app/icons - This directory has some image files.
* /app/scripts - There are all JavaScript files.
* /app/styles - There is one css style sheet definition file.
* /test - Currently, all files are garbage...
* /docs - Currently, there is one image file which is referenced by the README.md file.

At least, if you are a programmer, first you should enter the /app/scripts directory and see each JavaScript files to understand this app's behaviors.
